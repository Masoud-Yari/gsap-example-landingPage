# Getting Started with GSAP
There are many ways to get GSAP. Load it from a CDN, download it from our site, install it via NPM/Yarn, or get it from Github. There's even an interactive tool there that shows you the code for loading various plugins. The simplest way to add the core GSAP tools to your page is to use a script tag like this:

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.5.1/gsap.min.js"></script>
